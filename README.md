Express &amp; Rest Project
## Project description 
This is a school project for the FED20G class in front-end development. The page is a simple database api where data is taking from a json file and displayed in the browser. The user can create a new entity, edit an entity, retrieve data on a specific entity as well as delete an entity. The project is written in javascript, node and express and includes a rest client. 

To use the site, simply select a card and either 'edit' it make changes to the selected card, 'expand' it to get a more detailed view of the object in the browser, or 'delete' it to remove it from the database and browser. To create a new object click 'new' and fill in the input fields.
